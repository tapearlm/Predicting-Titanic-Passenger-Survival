# Predicting-Titanic-Passenger-Survival

This project is an attempt to predict the fate of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. 

This project is based off of the kaggle competition entitled "Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Training and test data are drawn from the kaggle competition page. 

This particular project serves as more of an educational and experimental project, rather than a serious prediction attempt, so many of the methods and code in this project are derived from Curt Wehrley's examination of this project, found here: https://github.com/wehrley/wehrley.github.io/blob/master/SOUPTONUTS.md
